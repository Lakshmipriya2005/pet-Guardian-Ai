🎯 Project Overview

Pet Guardian AI allows users to enter pet-related details and symptoms through a web interface. Based on the input, the system predicts a possible health condition using a trained machine learning model and displays the result to the user.

The project emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and practical learning rather than complex medical diagnosis.
